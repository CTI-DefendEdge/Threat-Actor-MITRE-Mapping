# MITRE-LAYERS

This repository is a curated collection of MITRE ATT&CK Navigator layers created by DefendEdge's CTI team. Each layer reflects our understanding of specific threat actors, based on intelligence we’ve collected. These layers visualize the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by each actor, mapped against the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## How to Use

To view a layer:

1. Copy the **raw GitHub URL** of any `.json` file in this repository
2. Visit the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator:  
   - [https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/]
3. Click `Open Existing Layer` → `From URL`
4. Paste the copied raw URL and click **>**

> You will now see a full ATT&CK matrix showing that threat actor’s known or suspected techniques.
